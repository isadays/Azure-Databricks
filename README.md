The Databricks File System (DBFS) is a distributed file system designed for cloud-based data analytics within the Databricks platform. It provides a central and scalable storage layer to seamlessly manage and access data in their data lake or cloud storage. DBFS is agnostic to the underlying cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, Google Cloud Storage) and provides a unified way to interact with data. Users can read, write, and manipulate data in DBFS using various programming languages and tools supported by Databricks. This abstraction simplifies data access and ensures data consistency, making it easier to collaborate on data-driven projects within Databricks while leveraging the power and scalability of cloud storage systems.


Serverless compute in Databricks refers to a flexible and cost-efficient approach to data processing and analytics where users can focus on their workloads without managing or provisioning clusters. Databricks, a unified analytics platform, automates cluster management and resource provisioning, allowing data engineers, data scientists, and analysts to run computations and workloads without the overhead of traditional infrastructure management. Key features of serverless compute in Databricks include automatic scaling, simplified cluster setup, and pay-as-you-go pricing, making it an ideal choice for data professionals seeking agility and cost-effectiveness in their data-driven projects.
