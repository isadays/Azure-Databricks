The Databricks File System (DBFS) is a distributed file system designed for cloud-based data analytics within the Databricks platform. It provides a central and scalable storage layer to seamlessly manage and access data in their data lake or cloud storage. DBFS is agnostic to the underlying cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, Google Cloud Storage) and provides a unified way to interact with data. Users can read, write, and manipulate data in DBFS using various programming languages and tools supported by Databricks. This abstraction simplifies data access and ensures data consistency, making it easier to collaborate on data-driven projects within Databricks while leveraging the power and scalability of cloud storage systems.
